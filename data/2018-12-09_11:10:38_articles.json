(WFLA) - A woman is suing employees of a Florida jail after they allegedly forced her to spend nearly 10 hours in a cell surrounded by 40 men because they suspected she was transgender,the Miami Herald reported.\n\nFior Pichardo de Veloz, 55, was had come to Miami from the Dominican Republic to witness the birth of her grandchild when she was arrested at the airport on an outstanding drug charge in 2013.\n\nThe arresting officer listed her gender as female. She was booked into Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center and processed as a woman, then strip-searched, the newspaper reported.\n\nDue to her history of high blood pressure, Pichardo was taken to a medical unit to be examined as a precaution. A nurse noted she had been taking hormone pills and asked her whether she was a man. Despite Pichardo's denial of this, the nurse added this note to her file: \"Transgender, male parts, female tendencies.\u201d\n\nThe nurse told the doctor, who reclassified Pichardo as male without an examination, according to a newly-released appeals court opinion.\n\nPichardo was then transferred to the all-male jail Metro West Detention Center and shared a cell with about 40 men, who jeered at her yelling 'Mami! Mami!', according to the report. She said she was terrified to go to the bathroom and \"urinated on herself instead.\"\n\nJail workers eventually realized their mistake once family members went to the jail where she was originally processed and demanded to know why she was moved.\n\nShe was taken out of her holding cell and given a new examination. She claimed several male officers laughed at her during that examination and someone took a photo.\n\nOnce her gender was confirmed, she was taken back to Turner Guilford Knight.\n\nPichardo sued the county and jail staff for negligence and \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" but the case was thrown out by a judge who said the jail staffers were protected from a trial for negligence.\n\nBut this month, an appeals court ruled the conduct of the nurse and doctor amounts to \u201cdeliberate indifference, the newspaper reported.\n\n\"Every reasonable prison officer and medical personnel would have known that wrongfully misclassifying a biological female as a male inmate and placing that female in the male population of a detention facility was unlawful,\" Judge Frank Hull wrote in an unanimous opinion.", "url": "https://www.wwlp.com/world/grandma-mistakenly-booked-into-all-male-jail-staff-thought-she-was-transgender/1633101688", "category": "business"}, {"id": 3, "title": "'It\u2019s the only way forward': Madrid bans polluting vehicles from city centre", "text": "From Friday, only vehicles producing zero emissions will be allowed to drive freely in downtown Madrid \u2013 making it a pollution pioneer in Europe\n\nBy 10.15 on Wednesday morning, Enrique Pelagio had parked his lorry in the chic Madrid neighbourhood of Chueca and was stacking the trolley that would bring the local cafes, bars and restaurants their daily bread and pastries.\n\nAcross the road was the van from the fruit and veg shop, while near the craft beer place sat a red delivery truck from the ubiquitous Mahou brewery.\n\nThis mini-murmuration of goods vehicles takes place throughout the capital several times a day, every day.\n\nBut change is afoot. On Friday, Madrid\u2019s latest anti-pollution measure comes into force: a ban on polluting vehicles in the city centre.\n\nThe plan, known as Madrid Central, establishes a low-emissions zone that covers 472 hectares (1,166 acres). All petrol vehicles registered before 2000 and diesel ones registered before 2006 will be banned from the area, unless they are used by residents of the area or meet other exemptions. The goal is to cut nitrogen dioxide levels by 23% in 2020 and put people \u2013 rather than the internal combustion engine \u2013 at the heart of transport policy.\n\nThere have been similar moves in other major cities: at the end of 2016, the mayors of Paris, Athens and Mexico City joined Madrid in announcing plans to take diesel cars and vans off their roads by 2025, and in May this year Hamburg became the first German city to ban some older diesel vehicles from two of its main roads.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Smog hangs over Mardrid and road signs warn of speed limits in place due to air pollution. Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Oslo, which had planned on making its city centre car-free, is now embarked on a drive to ensure it has the \u201cfewest possible vehicles\u201d. And in January last year Paris launched a colour-coded sticker scheme to ban all diesel cars registered between 1997 and 2000 between 8am and 8pm.\n\nMadrid\u2019s proposal, however, is bolder still: the only vehicles allowed to drive freely around the downtown area will be those that produce zero emissions.\n\nAs he stacks his trolley, Pelagio is more sanguine about the new rules than many of his colleagues, who say they can\u2019t afford to upgrade to cleaner vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way forward,\u201d he said. Besides, with fewer older cars and lorries, \u201cthere\u2019ll be more space\u201d.\n\nThere's a clear link between pollution peaks and hospital admissions In\u00e9s Saban\u00e9s, councillor\n\nThere will be some access under strict rules. Hybrids and LPG vehicles will be allowed into the area to park for a maximum of two hours, and more modern diesel and petrol vehicles will only be allowed in to park in public carparks or private garages.\n\nTruck drivers such as Pelagio, meanwhile, will be subject to a timetable: the oldest, most polluting lorries will only be admitted from 7am to 1pm, while more modern ones will see that window extended until 9pm.\n\nThe leftwing city council of Manuela Carmena, the mayor of Madrid, argues that the initiative is as much about public health as public transport.\n\n\u201cAir quality has been breaching acceptable levels for 10 years and people in the city are being exposed to air that has clear effects on their health, especially those who are most vulnerable, such as children and older people,\u201d said In\u00e9s Saban\u00e9s, councillor for the environment and mobility.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s research that shows clear links between pollution peaks and hospital admissions. It has a very clear effect on health \u2013 on the number of deaths and premature births.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s conservative opponents have tried to thwart the plan, arguing that it hasn\u2019t been executed correctly or been properly thought out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Madrid council says the plan will help to decentralise the city and ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and resources. Photograph: Samuel de Roman/Getty Images\n\nOthers have their own reasons. Antonio Villaverde, president of the Association of Self-employed Lorry Drivers (Ata), says that while his members are in favour of addressing Madrid\u2019s pollution problem, they simply don\u2019t have the money to buy new vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to replace 90% of our vehicles in Madrid over the course of just five years,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we wanted to, it\u2019s practically impossible. The problem with all this is that the sector is still using very old vehicles because of the economic crisis.\u201d\n\nVillaverde says the reduced delivery hours could have serious consequences. \u201cIf this goes ahead, I think two things will happen: there will be forced supply shortages in the city because we won\u2019t be able to deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of us will have to close our small businesses because we won\u2019t be able to buy new lorries.\u201d\n\nSaban\u00e9s disagrees with the gloomier predictions. Of the 2m or so daily journeys made to the city centre, 1.2m are already made on public transport, 550,000 on foot, and only 230,000 by car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a narrative around that the centre of Madrid is being shut down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. Lorry drivers, residents and their guests can enter the centre.\u201d\n\nGradually, vehicles will come to realise that they\u2019re not the ones in charge Jos\u00e9 Manuel Calvo, council representative\n\nPetrol and diesel taxis, as well as private hire vehicles, will be allowed into the zone until the end of 2022. The authorities won\u2019t start imposing fines on people who break the rules until next March.\n\nSaban\u00e9s also rejects suggestions that Madrid Central is drastic. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s among the strictest measures,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are different models, such as charging a lot to enter the centre of a city, or legal bans on driving in certain areas, like in Berlin. Madrid has gone for a mixed model, which will allow for a gradual implementation as we set about achieving our goals.\u201d\n\nShe likens it to the smoking ban that came in seven years ago: despite the initial dark mutterings, people quickly adjusted to the new norms. There was also grumbling in some quarters 35 years ago when Madrid banned cars from its most famous park, El Retiro.\n\nIf there is opposition, argues the councillor, it is not coming from neighbourhood groups, environmental campaigners or health professionals. \u201cThey\u2019re all saying that\u2019s it\u2019s already overdue and needs to happen now..\u201d\n\nPaco Segura, coordinator of environmental group Ecologists in Action, couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nFor years, he says, successive Madrid councils have been in denial over the scale of the city\u2019s pollution problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve filed dozens of complaints and put out a ton of reports with official figures that show that, year after year, we\u2019re going above the legal limits.\n\n\u201cOur main criticism of this plan is that it\u2019s come so late. Studies show that this is responsible for the premature deaths of about 3,000 people a year. Not acting as quickly as possible would be totally immoral.\u201d\n\nAs far as the city council is concerned, Madrid Central is not a war on cars but rather a challenge to their dominance and a push towards better co-existence between vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nIt is also about geography and social equality. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Calvo, the city council\u2019s representative for sustainable urban development, says the plan will help to decentralise Madrid and ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and resources.\n\n\u201cWe needs to redress the balance so that there isn\u2019t such a high concentration of activity in the centre compared with peripheral areas,\u201d he said.\n\nCalvo insists ways can be found to cut pollution while still preserving life in the centre of Madrid so that it remains a place where people can live, work, eat, drink and shop, and which tourists want to visit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest About 3,000 people die prematurely in Madrid every year due to pollution. Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe points to the \u201clast mile\u201d distribution models being developed in other cities, whereby goods are delivered to warehouses close to the centre of town and ferried to customers in sustainable vehicles including bicycles.\n\nOne day, he hopes, the Spanish capital will more closely resemble the northwestern city of Pontevedra, which banned all but essential traffic in its centre almost 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt would be on another scale, but it\u2019s possible. With Madrid Central, the whole of the centre will become a shared space, with reduced speed limits and more pavement.\n\n\u201cGradually, vehicles will come to realise that they\u2019re not the ones in charge.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/nov/30/its-the-only-way-forward-madrid-bans-polluting-vehicles-from-city-centre", "category": "sport"}, {"id": 4, "title": "Special counsel says Paul Manafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters,\" breaching plea deal", "text": "The special counsel filed a memo Friday revealing more about what former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied about when he was supposed to be cooperating with federal investigators. His cooperation with the government was part of a plea agreement to avoid his second trial, focused in part on allegations related to money laundering and his foreign lobbying.\n\nThe special counsel said that his lies to federal investigators were not simply \"memory lapses\" on the part of Manafort.\n\nAccording to the special counsel's memo, Manafort lied about several things in breach of his plea deal, including his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik, who ran Manafort's office in Kiev. Kilimnik, who has ties to Russian intelligence, was indicted in June. Much of the information about Kilimnik was redacted in the filing, although Manafort admitted he conspired with Kilimnik to obstruct justice.\n\nThe special counsel also alleged that Manafort lied about a payment made toward a debt incurred by him to a firm that was working for him in 2017. According to the filing, he also provided false information to the Justice Department about another investigation.\n\nAnd while Manafort said he had no \"direct or indirect communications\" with anyone in the Trump administration and never \"asked anyone to try to communicate a message to anyone in the Administration,\" the special counsel says he was lying about this, too. He asked someone to speak with an administration official on his behalf by text on May 26, 2018 and had been in communication with a senior administration official through February 2018.\n\nRead the special counsel's memo here:\n\nManafort met with the special counsel and the FBI on 12 occasions, three prior to his guilty plea. He also testified twice before the grand jury on October 26 and November 2.\n\nIn its indictment of Manafort and Kilimnik in June, the special counsel office found that Manafort, with the assistance of aide Rick Gates, Kilimnik, and others, engaged in a multimillion dollar lobbying campaign in the United States at the direction of Ukrainian officials. Manafort and Kilimnik did so without registering and providing the disclosures required by law.\n\nIn late November, the special counsel said that Manafort had breached his plea agreement with the government by lying to federal investigators. Manafort was convicted of various financial crimes in August before reaching an agreement in September to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nManafort's attorneys maintained at the time that he believed he had provided truthful information and didn't agree that he had violated his plea agreement.\n\nAttorneys for Manafort wrote in the filing that Manafort \"has provided information to the government in an effort to live up to his cooperation obligations.\"\n\nManafort was convicted on eight out of 18 counts of financial crimes including bank fraud and tax fraud in federal court in Virginia in August. Prosecutors alleged Manafort hid tens of millions of dollars in overseas income over several decades, including his time as chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016. President Trump has consistently and repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a tweet appearing to refer to the various memos released Friday night, Mr. Trump wrote, \"Totally clears the President. Thank you!\"\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that the filing \"says absolutely nothing about the President.\"\n\n\"It says even less about collusion and is devoted almost entirely to lobbying-related issues.

So far, SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stages have made at most two flights before being retired. But the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket launching Monday is making its third flight to space after launching the Bangabandhu-1 communications satellitefor the government of Bangladesh in May and the Merah Putih satellitefor PT Telkom Indonesia in August. That May launch marked the first of a Block 5 Falcon 9, an upgraded version of SpaceX's workhorse booster designed for at least 10 flights, if not more, as part of the company's reusability program to drive down the cost of spaceflight. As on its two previous flights, the Falcon 9 first stage is expected to return to Earth. It will land on SpaceX's drone ship \"Just Read the Instructions\" in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nA close look at SpaceX's first Falcon 9 rocket first stage booster to make a third flight. The Block 5 booster launched two satellites into orbit in summer 2018 and is the first to fly a third time. Credit: SpaceX\n\nThere's also the number of SpaceX launches this year. SpaceX closed out 2017 with 18 launches, a record at the time and a significant step up from its previous record of eight flights. Monday's launch will mark SpaceX's 19th launch of 2018, setting a new record that the company will then break on Tuesday (Dec. 4) when it launches a Dragon cargo ship to the International Space Station for NASA from Cape Canaveral, Florida. More SpaceX launches are scheduled for this month, so expect that record to be just over 20 by the end of the year.\n\nAnd finally, there's the payload. The Falcon 9 launch will be dedicated rideshare mission for the company Spaceflight, which is sending up 64 different small satellites on this flight. So there's literally a lot (of satellites) riding on this mission for SpaceX and its customer.\n\nYou can watch SpaceX launch its milestone Block 5 Falcon 9 mission live on Monday. SpaceX will webcast the launch live here, and you can see it on Space.com here, courtesy of the company.

He shot and stabbed her and also stabbed their children, Jesse, 11, and Sophia, 8, Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said.\n\nHe then took some documents and set a fire in the basement, officials said.\n\nSuspect set his own home on fire\n\nWhen Paul left his brother's house that morning, he went to his home in Ocean Township, still under the cover of darkness. He poured gasoline outside his two-story home while his family slept inside and ignited it, a criminal complaint alleges.\n\nBy 5 a.m., firefighters and police were on their way to Paul's home. Someone had called 911, saying they'd seen smoke.\n\nA fire started at Paul Caneiro's home in Ocean Township while the family was sleeping. They escaped were unharmed.\n\nWhen first responders arrived, Paul, his wife and their daughters were already outside. They were unharmed.\n\nA fire was burning behind the residence and a smaller fire was located near the garage door.\n\nPaul Caneiro put his family in danger, Gramiccioni said, when he tried to destroy the evidence he brought with him from his brother's home and tried to make it seem like both families were being targeted.\n\nPaul's attorney, Robert A. Honecker, said Paul helped his family evacuate after a fire broke out at their home and waited with them until police and firefighters arrived.\n\nHours later, the family went to the town's police headquarters, where all of them were questioned. Paul would remain there for the next 12 hours until he was arrested around midnight.\n\nKillings were hidden by flames\n\nBack at the Colts Neck mansion, a fire was growing hotter and hotter, scorching the rooms of the more than 5,700-square-foot home.\n\nIt was a normal day on quiet Willow Brook Road, where Keith's mansion stood out from the others because of its modern architecture. As the sun rose, children took off on buses for the last full day of classes before Thanksgiving, and adults began commuting to work.\n\nJust after 12:30 p.m., more than six hours after the fire at Paul Caneiro's home, dozens of firefighters responded to the 1-acre property. A neighbor's groundskeeper had smelled smoke coming from the home and his boss called 911, the Asbury Park Press reported.\n\nFirefighters contained the fire about 24 hours after it was reported.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived, they made a gruesome discovery. Keith was dead in front of the home, while the bodies of the rest of the family were severely burned inside.\n\nPlumes of smoke poured out of the home as fire crews saturated the structure and the lawn around it. They wouldn't put down the fire until about a day later, and they wouldn't let investigators inside, fearing -- among other safety concerns -- that the roof could cave in.\n\nATF is currently lending our technical expertise to the investigation led by @MonCoProsecutor and @MonmouthPDFDEMS of an arson with multiple fatalities in Colts Neck, NJ. pic.twitter.com/lHe3x2xf5w \u2014 ATF Newark (@ATF_Newark) November 21, 2018\n\nWithin hours, investigators announced the family had been targeted and were victims of homicide.\n\nPaul Caneiro sat in jail, accused of setting his own home on fire. And suspicions were increasing that he was involved in the deaths of his brother and his family.\n\nMore than a week later, Paul was accused of the killings. He now faces four counts of murder, two counts of aggravated arson and two firearm violations, records show.\n\nIf convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nProsecutors have said he acted alone and have no reason to believe that organized crime was involved.\n\nMoney broke their 'best friends' relationship\n\nThe troubles between the Caneiro brothers may have involved money.\n\nThey worked together for three decades, after Keith founded a technology consulting company and brought Paul on as his first employee.\n\nThe company appeared to be very successful, adding Wall Street names such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to their clients list through the years.\n\nPaul Caneiro made his first appearance in a Monmouth County on Friday.\n\n\"By the time the internet bubble was about to burst in 2001, their technology business had grown to $4.5 million in annual sales and 26 employees,\" the Asbury Park Press newspaper reported.\n\nAnother sign of their partnership was the company's name, Jay-Martin Consulting, which combined the brothers' middle names. Later, they would rename the firm Square One.\n\nBefore the killings, the Caneiros had been operating the tech firm alongside a pest control company out of a brick building on a main road in Asbury Park, according to the city's public records.\n\nThe motive in the killings was financial, prosecutors say, and stemmed from the brothers' joint business ventures. Authorities have not discussed any more details about the motive but have said investigators have launched an investigation into the Caneiro's business dealings.\n\nPaul Caneiro's attorneys, Robert Honecker and Mitchell Ansell, said their client was wrongfully accused and that he \"had absolutely nothing to do with these horrific crimes.\"\n\n\"Paul's family means more to him than anything else in the world,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"There is absolutely no reason in the world for Paul Caneiro to have committed the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He would never hurt any member of his family. The process today can begin for a search for the truth and who committed these horrendous acts.\"\n\nThe brothers not only worked together, the attorneys said, they considered themselves best friends and were each other's best man at their weddings.\n\nA loving family led by a tech businessman\n\nCandles, photos and flowers have slowly filled the steps of the Colts Neck Town Hall to mourn a loving family who enjoyed traveling to Greece and exercising together.\n\nKeith wanted to keep developing his career and had just earned a master's degree in technology management from Columbia University in New York.\n\nIn his thesis, he focused on technology that could \"solve world hunger by matching excess foods with hungry people,\" he wrote in his LinkedIn profile.\n\nTributes hung on a fence in front of the Colts Neck mansion.\n\nHe was committed to exercising and was a regular at a local gym, according to his obituary. His trainer, Brian Bott, wrote on Facebook that Keith, who was initially introverted, made jokes, took over the radio and overall made other people felt like they belonged there.\n\n\"If you trained in the morning here you knew Keith. He had that way about him. Keith was an 'idea' guy and I think it's why him and I got along so well,\" Bott wrote. \"We'd talk about business, music, movies, or anything really, but I sincerely enjoyed my conversations with him and the way they would challenge me intellectually.\"\n\nA video posted on the gym's Facebook page shows Caneiro doing push-ups while his young daughter helps out, providing a little extra weight on his back.\n\nKeith was also an avid reader, reading multiple books in a week, and loved sports.\n\nLike her husband, Jennifer Caneiro enjoyed exercising, going to the beach and traveling with the family to their home in Greece, her obituary says.\n\nFriends and family of Keith Caneiro and his family gathered outside the Colts Neck Town Hall for a candlelight vigil honoring last week.\n\nShe was a graduate of the University of Albany and a member of the parent-teacher organization at her children's school. She enjoyed hosting family parties \"for every holiday at her home.\"\n\nThe couple's daughter, Sophia, was a third-grader and a Girl Scout who loved Ninja classes. She enjoyed baking cookies, ice skating, gymnastics and the New York Yankees.\n\n\"Sophia was a vibrant, enthusiastic and precocious girl, who enjoyed the arts. Her positive energy was contagious,\" according to her obituary.\n\nSon Jesse was a fifth-grader with an impressive knowledge of world events. He knew everything about the two World Wars and could engage anyone in conversations about current world events. He loved to play the blockbuster video game \"Fortnite, \" and build Lego structures, his obituary says.\n\nMore than a week after the family was found dead, their home was boarded up and children's drawings with smiley faces and rainbows hung on a wire fence placed outside.\n\n\"Forever in our hearts,\" a child wrote in a tribute for them.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/02/us/new-jersey-mansion-fire-wrap/index.html", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 10, "title": "Cheap oil is no longer a huge positive for the US economy", "text": "New York (CNN Business) 1. Crude reality: Cheap oil used to be a slam-dunk positive for the American economy.\n\nAbrupt declines in oil prices would create huge savings for consumers and businesses alike. It was like a massive tax cut -- and one that didn't blow up the federal deficit.\n\nBut the shale oil boom has since changed that equation. The United States today is not only the largest guzzler of oil, it's vaulted to the top of the production leaderboard as well. US output recently surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia for the first time since 1973.\n\nThat means even though President Donald Trump is calling for oil prices to go lower, there are significant negative consequences of the deepening bear market in oil.\n\nLower oil prices threaten to wipe out jobs, set off cash crunches at overleveraged frackers and depress business spending. The 2014-2016 oil crash caused hundreds of thousands of job cuts and dozens of bankruptcies.\n\n\"The US now responds to lower oil prices like an OPEC member,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote to clients last week. \"When the president calls for lower oil prices, he's ignoring the new reality.\"\n\nCrude plummeted 22% in November, marking the worst month since October 2008. Despite that meltdown, Trump has repeatedly pressured OPEC and Saudi Arabia not to dial back production to balance the market. OPEC and Russia are nonetheless expected to seriously consider slashing output at Thursday's highly-anticipated meeting in Vienna, Austria.\n\nOf course, the recent plunge in oil prices is not nearly on the same level of the last downturn. And millions of Americans are enjoying a windfall caused by the slump. And that's a huge plus because the United States is still a consumer-led economy.\n\nA gallon of gasoline fetched $2.49 on Friday, down from $2.80 a month ago, according to AAA. Consumers could use that extra cash to splurge on Amazon (AMZN) this holiday season.\n\nBut many residents of Texas, North Dakota, Alaska and other oil-producing states are not celebrating. Crashing oil prices can threaten their livelihoods.\n\n\"The decline in oil prices is not an unalloyed good,\" said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher. \"The benefits are dispersed but the hits are geographically concentrated.\"\n\nFaucher said that he believes the impact of cheap oil is now neutral on the overall US economy.\n\nThe shale revolution has set off a hiring boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Some jobs could be at risk if oil prices stay cheap.\n\nShale is a gamechanger\n\nConsider what happened during the 2014-2016 oil crash. Gasoline prices plummeted from $3.70 a gallon to just $1.72, according to federal government stats. That helped boost consumer spending.\n\nAnd yet US GDP growth decelerated sharply from above 3% in early 2015 to sub 2% the next year. Capital spending in the mining sector, which is mostly oil, plunged by $149 billion, or 61%, from peak to trough, according to Shepherdson. He found that matched the pick-up in consumer spending over that span.\n\nOne big shift is that shale oil now makes up at least half of America's oil output. And shale oil companies, unlike their larger rivals, quickly ramp up and down their activity based on price swings. And when that happens, other parts of the economy feel the impact. The pain from cheap oil can spill over into steel, manufacturing, real estate, transportation, logistics and banking.\n\nAll told, Shepherdson estimates that the oil crash wiped 0.3 percentage points off US GDP growth in 2014 and another 0.2 percentage points in 2015.\n\n\"In the shale new world, lower oil prices mean slower US growth,\" Shepherdson wrote.\n\n2. Trade truce: Presisdent Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping, the leaders of the world's two largest economies, agreed to a temporary ceasefire in the trade war between the United States and China.\n\nAfter the two-and-a-half hour discussion at the G20 summit in Argentina, Trump agreed to maintain the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, and not raise them to 25% \"at this time\" ahead of a January 1 deadline, according to a White House statement from press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nIn exchange, China agreed it was willing to purchase a \"very substantial\" amount of agriculture, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance.\n\nCalling the extended meeting \"friendly and candid,\" Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two leaders had agreed to open their markets to each other and to step up negotiations toward elimination of all additional tariffs.\n\nSome analysts warn that the truce could be short-lived. \"In short, this was not a breakthrough on substance, but a framework to continue talks. We have long warned of the risk that such a general agreement could break down,\" Eurasia Group said.\n\n3. Jobs numbers: Will November be another strong month for adding jobs? We'll find out on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases new numbers for last month.\n\nIn October, the US economy added 250,000 jobs in October, which significantly exceeded expectations. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a 49-year low. Hispanic unemployment reached its lowest rate ever, at 4.4%.\n\n5. Retail earnings: Some stores are reporting earnings this week including Dollar General (DG), Restoration Hardware (RH), and Ulta (ULTA).\n\nIt's been a strong year for Dollar General: the stock is up nearly 19% for the year. CEO Todd Vasos said on its last earnings call that despite the strong economy, weak wage growth has attracted more shoppers that live paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\n6.

In June, Manafort was sent to jail pending his then-upcoming trials after investigators accused him of witness tampering.

Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign colluded with the Russians to undermine the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nManafort had faced prosecution by Mueller in two separate cases, one in Washington, D.C., the other in Virginia. In September, Manafort cut a deal with Mueller's team and agreed to plead guilty to charges related that he was engaged in a conspiracy involving money laundering, tax fraud, failing to report foreign bank accounts, violating rules requiring registration of foreign agents, lying and witness tampering. The deal came a few weeks after a jury in Virginia found him guilty on several counts of financial fraud.\n\nThe charges lodged by Mueller's team largely relate to Manafort's work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine, which he performed years before he joined the Trump campaign.\n\nManafort was also one of the Trump campaign officials to attend a June 2016 meeting with Russian government-connected operatives at Trump Tower in New York, which was coordinated by Donald Trump, Jr. in the hope of hearing what was claimed to be damaging information about Clinton. Trump's son-in-law and current senior advisor Jared Kushner also attended that meeting.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors said that under the terms of the plea deal, Manafort was required to be \"fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly\" cooperative with the government.

That would include its agreement to reduce sentencing guidelines in exchange for acceptance of responsibility.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast week, lawyers for Trump said they had submitted the president's written answers to the special counsel.\n\n\"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers and a conservative radio host.

If one day they can't jump over the wall, they suddenly lose their creativity\u200d. LOL\n\nWhen I was in college, the best students directly copied the most famous foreign designs and then changed its exotic forms into their own styles. Such students were praised by the teachers for \"adept at learning quickly.\"\n\nThis graduation design was \u201cso excellent\u201d that was chosen for the logo of our institute...\n\nOriginal creator\u2192Behance\n\nThese plagiarists don\u2018t have to worry about any copyright issues because the outer world is \u201cnever exist\u201d to their audience.

This establishes an \u201cinformation isolated island\u201d driven by interests.\n\nIn contrast, NLP of Google resembles a Tower of Babel where any content can be written in any language and read by anyone using any language. Preventing Google is equivalent to barred Mandarin and Simplified Chinese from being outside the world civilization.\n\nNumerous of Chinese companies have benefited from this isolated wall (GFW construct an \u201ceconomic moat\u201d for these companies to resist foreign competition) . Consumers inside the wall as lambs (to be slaughtered) for them.\n\n5. Why do Fansub groups burn subtitles in the video?\n\nFor provides content for spectator excluded from the real WORLD WIDE WEB, the caption translate teams get over the wall, downloads the videos on YouTube and movies & serial on Netflix, translates them and directly burn-in subtitles with soft advertisements.\n\nWhy burn in? Since China is an information isolated island with a \u201cLAN\u201d detached from the world but we indulgence in \u201cinvolution\u201d.\n\nIt seems to establish a barrier between China and the rest of the international community which lead to Chinese creation can\u2019t be viewed by other linguistic speakers).\n\nJust as backwater scarcely ripples, this makes the massive precipitative video data stagnant and dead. (Maybe this is the reason why Chinese products never go out of the country). But information \u201cdesire\u201d stream free.\n\nE.g. subtitles on YouTube can be auto-generated, searched and translated into any language, making all videos an \u201cinvisible treasure\u201d in any country.\n\n6. The \u201ccontent carry\u201d industry has created millions of jobs\n\n\u201cinformation carriers\u201d (mediocre philistines who deficient in creativity) access blocked sites (from Medium \u2019s to Reddit \u2019s, from English to Thai\u2026), download its content, translated and self-censor them then transport to the domestic platform.\n\n(mediocre philistines who deficient in creativity) access blocked sites (from \u2019s to \u2019s, from English to Thai\u2026), download its content, translated and them then transport to the domestic platform. They offer the audience (restricted internet access) with censored content .\n\n. There were counterpart Chinese \u201cspecialized in\u201d translating and carrying the corresponding content in almost every specific sub-segments even if in minority Subreddit\u2026\n\nThese formed an industrial cluster which has created millions of jobs for China market.\n\n(e.g. The seller downloads the video from YouTube and sells it at Taobao for \uffe525 per set.)\n\n7. Chinese students studying abroad -a \u201cwalking translation machine\u201d & \u201cConveying robots\u201d\n\nA lot of international students\u200d\u200d from China do sideline to be a procurement agent. They are not only ferrying foreign cool stuff but also translate fantastic overseas content and conveying them on WeChat Subscription Accounts (similar to Facebook Pages) immediately. They continually updating and keep operating in there to share the latest frontiers which making them become the KOL.\n\nIf a Google junior engineer (bottom tier employees with an annual salary of \u2248$100,000) returns Sino bringing technical details and confidentiality, he hop and can be offered CTO getting a million salary yearly.\n\nWhile Liu Ruopeng, a PhD student at Duke University, stealing intellectual property from a US Department of Defense-funded laboratory. After returning to China, he became the president of the Shenzhen-based Kuang-Chi Institute of Advanced Technology and the chairman of Hong Kong-listed KuangChi Science.\n\nIronically, he was reputed as \"China\u2019s Musk\" and can shake hands with Chinese leaders twice a year cause everyone believes him to have created it. In such a worldview of people - the world might seem to extraterrestrial, China is the whole world, and anything copied from abroad will belong to theirs.\n\n8.

Some Pictures Corporations were compelled by unstable and unclear rules to re-edit the movies and shows which screened more than dozens of years ago.\n\nSome videos I uploaded a few years ago has been removed from the platform on account of the regulatory tightening recently. It is a disaster and uncontrollable to create original content.\n\nThese limited and shackled the author's imagination.\n\nFor the purpose of \u201dRisk-Control\u201d , capital usually allows the studio to produce low-risk content, that is, to praise the motherland's great rivers or the friendly political-correct content.\n\nAll of this makes original content creating impossible but plagiarism, and \u201cjusticial\u201d adapting of foreign content straightforwardly. Even if they discover foreign content found by themselves and just put their watermark on it (this is really incredible).\n\nMovies with different perspective failed to get past the censors, and there is no room for self-media to speak for the niche...

At a meeting today at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Versailles, France, delegates voted to redefine the International System of Units (SI), changing the world\u2019s definition of the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole. The changes will now come into force on 20 May 2019.\n\nThere are seven base units of the SI: the second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela. Some have long been based on physical constants. The metre, for example, has been defined since 1983 as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 seconds. But the four that metrologists today agreed to redefine were previously based on something \u2013 i.e. an object, experiment or phenomenon \u2014 meaning that its value is not universal.\n\nNew definitions\n\nToday\u2019s decision means that all seven SI units will now be defined in terms of physical constants. The biggest change will be to the kilogram, which is currently set by a 143-year-old platinum alloy cylinder, dubbed \u201cLe Grand K\u201d housed in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris. The kilogram will now be defined in terms of the Planck constant, h, which has been measured with extraordinary precision in recent years. Its agreed value will be set as 6.626 070 15 \u00d7 10\u201334 kg m2 s\u20131.\n\nThe ampere, meanwhile, will be set by the elementary electrical charge, e, which is given as 1.602 176 634 \u00d7 10\u201319 when expressed in coulombs. The Kelvin will be defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380 649 \u00d7 10\u201423 when expressed in the unit J K-1 and the mole by the Avogadro constant (N A ) contains exactly 6.02 214 076 \u00d7 1023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N A , when expressed in the unit mol\u20131. Read more SI gets a makeover\n\nIn daily life, however, the new SI units will have little immediate practical consequence. While the units may be defined differently, the goal has been to keep their size the same. Yet defining the units based on physical constants means that scientists will be able to measure them at any place or time, and on any scale. \u201cThe SI redefinition is a landmark moment in scientific measurement,\u201d says Jan-Theodoor Janssen, director of research at the UK\u2019s National Physical Laboratory. \u201cThis will pave the way for far more accurate measurements and lays a more stable foundation for science.\u201d", "url": "https://physicsworld.com/a/kilogram-finally-redefined-as-worlds-metrologists-agree-to-new-formulation-for-si-units/", "category": "tech"}, {"id": 26, "title": "Spain plans to ban alternative medicine in health centres", "text": "The Spanish government has announced plans to eradicate alternative medicine such as acupuncture or homeopathy from health centres.\n\nThe proposal, unveiled by the science and health ministers, aims to avoid the \u201cpotential harmful effects\u201d of the practices when they are used as an alternative or a complement to treatment that is itself based on \u201cproof and scientific rigour\u201d, the government said in a statement.\n\nIt did not make clear what it regarded as alternative medicine, but gave the examples of acupuncture and homeopathy. \u201cMany people still believe that some treatments work despite there being no scientific proof available,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe government said it wanted to eliminate alternative medicine from health centres, where all treatment must be given by recognised professionals.\n\nIt also wants to avoid alternative medicine being taught in Spanish universities by developing alliances with deans, chancellors or Spanish regional authorities to end the awarding of diplomas linked to these practices.\n\nThe issue has taken centre stage in Spain recently, with health and science professionals pressuring the health ministry to take action after several high-profile deaths.\n\nOne such case, as reported by Spain\u2019s Association to Protect Patients against Pseudo-scientific Therapies, involved 21-year-old Mario Rodriguez, who died after stopping his hospital treatment for leukemia in favour of a supposed naturopath who said he could cure cancer with vitamins.\n\n\u201cDad, I made a mistake,\u201d his father, Julian Rodriguez, quoted him as saying on his deathbed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/14/spain-plans-ban-alternative-medicine-health-centres", "category": "politics"}, {"id": 27, "title": "Saudi Arabia is slashing oil shipments to US, a tactic that boosts prices and may rile Trump", "text": "Saudi Arabia is slashing shipments of crude to the United States, a move that appears calibrated to boost oil prices after a swift and punishing sell-off.\n\nThe move could put the kingdom at loggerheads with President Donald Trump, who wants to drive down energy costs for Americans and frequently accuses the Saudi-led OPEC cartel of jacking up oil prices.\n\nThe Saudis are loading fewer barrels on ships bound for the United States this month, continuing a trend that began in September, according to an analysis by tanker-tracking firm ClipperData. The firm's loading estimate suggests that U.S. imports of Saudi crude oil could soon fall toward the lowest levels on record.\n\nSending fewer barrels to the United States means U.S. crude stockpiles are more likely to drop, and shrinking inventories tend to push up oil prices. It's a tactic the Saudis used last year to amplify their main strategy for draining a global crude glut and propping up the market: cutting output alongside fellow OPEC members, Russia and several other producers.\n\nThe maneuver shows how Saudi Arabia's efforts to manage the oil market have evolved. During the 2014-2016 oil price crash, traders closely monitored weekly U.S. stockpile data to see whether oversupply was shrinking or growing. As the world's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia realized it could nudge the data in a direction that boosts the cost of crude.\n\n\"It worked so well in 2017 for [the Saudis] to cut flows to the U.S. because people could see the inventories dropping because U.S. data is so timely and transparent,\" said Matt Smith, head of commodities research at ClipperData.\n\n\"The markets have become more transparent through tanker tracking,\" Smith said. \"You can see those changes being implemented more, and [the Saudis are] aware of that.\"\n\nNovember's drop in Saudi barrels bound for the United States follows a six-week oil market rout that saw prices plunge 25 percent into bear market territory. It also comes after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih warned on Monday that OPEC, Russia and several other producers may soon launch a fresh round of price-boosting output cuts.\n\nShortly after Falih issued the warning, Trump took to Twitter to voice his disapproval with that plan.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia may not be swayed by Trump's pressure campaign. In recent days, Smith and other energy analysts have claimed that Trump essentially duped OPEC and its allies into raising output earlier this year.\n\nThe analysts say Trump's threats to impose harsh sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, played a part in convincing the producers to stop capping output and start pumping more oil. But Trump ultimately allowed some of Iran's biggest customers to keep importing its oil, which meant the oil squeeze the alliance feared never materialized.\n\nConsequently, the producers put even more oil into a market that is swinging toward oversupply, giving traders another reason to sell off crude futures and push prices lower.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/saudi-arabia-cuts-oil-shipments-to-us-in-likely-bid-to-boost-prices.html", "category": "business"}, {"id": 28, "title": "Man sues British Airways for being seated next to obese passenger, claims he was injured", "text": "CLOSE The legal contract between you and the airline does not say you have a right to a full seat.

(AP) \u2014 A Tennessee inmate grimaced and waved goodbye before saying \u201clet\u2019s rock,\u201d moments before he became the first man executed in the electric chair in that state since 2007, put to death Thursday for shooting two men and slitting their throats during a drug deal decades ago.\n\nEdmund Zagorski, 63, was pronounced dead at 7:26 p.m. Thursday at a Nashville maximum-security prison, officials said.\n\nAsked by the prison warden if he had any last words in the death chamber, Zagorski said, \u201cLet\u2019s rock,\u201d shortly before the execution was carried out.\n\nA reporter who witnessed the scene said at a post-execution news briefing that Zagorski could be seen smiling while strapped down. A large sea sponge that had been doused in salt water was soon placed on his head. While guards wiped his face clear of water dripping down his face, Zagorski quietly said there was still water under his nose and asked for it to be removed before his face was shrouded with a large black cloth.\n\nThe witnesses said the inmate\u2019s fists then clenched when the electricity was applied and his body tensed and appeared to rise during the two times the current went through him. He did not move afterward.\n\nFive media witnesses watched Zagorski\u2019s execution along with Zagorski\u2019s attorney, the prison\u2019s chaplain and a representative from the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAnother reporter said Zagorski\u2019s attorney Kelly Henry was nodding, smiling and tapping her heart just before the execution got underway. When asked about her actions, Henry said afterward: \u201cI told him when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.\u201d\n\nShe said Zagorski told her the last thing he wanted to see was her smiling face, and so she made an effort to smile at him before the shroud was put over his face. After it was done, Henry quietly wiped away tears.\n\nLater, Henry said it appeared that Zagorski\u2019s pinkies had become dislocated. She said that can be common when the body undergoes such extreme blunt force trauma.\n\nA phone hung on the wall in the witness room, allowing Henry to have access to a telephone should anything have gone wrong. A federal judge had earlier this week ordered the state to have a phone accessible.\n\nIn opting for the electric chair over a lethal injection as Tennessee allowed him, Zagorski had argued it would be a quicker and less painful way to die. He became only the second person to die in the electric chair in Tennessee since 1960. Nationwide, only 14 other people have been put to death in the electric chair since 2000, including a Virginia inmate in 2013.\n\nThe execution was carried out minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday evening denied the inmate\u2019s request for a stay. Zagorski\u2019s attorneys had argued it was unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection.\n\nThe state came close to administering an injection to Zagorski three weeks ago, a plan halted by Tennessee\u2019s governor when Zagorski exercised his right to request the electric chair.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s statement said Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the dissenting voice on Thursday, noting Zagorski\u2019s difficult decision to opt for the electric chair. In Tennessee, condemned inmates whose crimes occurred before 1999 can choose the electric chair \u2014 one of a handful of states that allow such a choice.\n\n\u201cHe did so not because he thought that it was a humane way to die, but because he thought that the three-drug cocktail that Tennessee had planned to use was even worse,\u201d Sotomayor said in the statement. \u201cGiven what most people think of the electric chair, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more striking testament \u2014 from a person with more at stake \u2014 to the legitimate fears raised by the lethal-injection drugs that Tennessee uses.\u201d\n\nZagorski was convicted of an April 1983 double slaying. Prosecutors said Zagorski shot John Dotson and Jimmy Porter and then slit their throats after robbing the two men after they came to him to buy marijuana.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether use of the electric chair violates the 8th Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but it came close about 20 years ago after a series of botched electrocutions in Florida. During two executions in the 1990s, smoke and flames shot from the condemned inmates\u2019 heads. In 1999, blood spilled from under an inmate\u2019s mask. Shortly afterward, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the electric chair. But the case was dropped when Florida made lethal injection its primary execution method.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Haslam declined to intervene in Zagorski\u2019s case despite receiving pleas from correctional officers, Zagorski\u2019s priest and former jurors who convicted the inmate.\n\nAt the time of Zagorski\u2019s conviction, Tennessee juries were not given the option of considering life without parole.\n\nProtesters held vigils Thursday in Knoxville and Memphis, and outside the prison where Zagorski was executed. There some raised a banner with the words: \u201cA Free Tennessee is Execution-Free.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Travis Loller contributed to this report in Nashville.", "url": "https://clarksvillenow.com/local/tn-death-row-inmate-smiles-says-lets-rock-before-dying-in-electric-chair/", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 32, "title": "U.S. regulator demands companies take action to halt 'robocalls'", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Monday wrote the chief executives of major telephone service providers and other companies, demanding they launch a system no later than 2019 to combat billions of \u201crobocalls\u201d and other nuisance calls received monthly by American consumers.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Ajit Pai speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018.

Scott Beierle, 40, was named by Tallahassee police as the shooter who opened fire inside the Hot Yoga Tallahassee studio, killing two women, and injuring four other women and a man. Those killed were identified as Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, who worked at Florida State University\u2019s College of Medicine, and FSU student Maura Binkley, 21. On a YouTube channel in 2014, Beierle filmed several videos of himself offering extremely racist and misogynistic opinions, in which he called women \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cwhores\u201d and lamented \u201cthe collective treachery\u201d of girls he had gone to high school with. \u201cThere are whores in \u2014 not only every city, not only every town, but every village,\u201d he said, referring to women in interracial relationships, whom he said had betrayed \u201ctheir blood.\u201d Officer Damon Miller of the Tallahassee Police Department said he could not tell BuzzFeed News whether women were specifically targeted in the attack or whether the online posts were a subject of the police investigation into the attack. \u201cEverything that he has a connection to we\u2019re investigating right now,\u201d Miller said. Police said they were still trying to identify a motive, but noted Beierle had previously been investigated for harassing women. In one video called \u201cPlight of the Adolescent Male,\u201d Beierle named Elliot Rodger, who killed six people and injured 14 in a shooting in Isla Vista, California.

He also mentioned a girl who canceled dates on him. \u201cI could have ripped her head off,\u201d he said.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson told BuzzFeed News Beierle served from 2008 to 2010. Unlike the YouTube videos, Beierle\u2019s songs on SoundCloud were all uploaded in the last few months. Shortly before Friday\u2019s shooting, he uploaded one song called \u201cFuck \u2019Em All,\u201d which included the lyrics \u201cTo hell with the boss that won\u2019t get off my back / To hell with the girl I can\u2019t get in the sack.\u201d\n\nAnother song, called \u201cNobody\u2019s Type,\u201d featured him lamenting that women didn\u2019t find him attractive. \u201cI\u2019m no athletic shark.

In one video, he said that he resented having to subsidize as a taxpayer \u201cthe casual sex lives of slutty girls\u201d through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception provisions. In the same video, he also criticized \u201cthe invasion of Central American children\u201d in the US that year and said the migrants seeking asylum should be deported on barges. The Tallahassee shooting comes after a spate of deadly violence from the far right in the past two weeks. On Oct. 27, a far-right extremist shouting anti-Semitic phrases opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11. That came just three days after a man shot dead two black people in Louisville, Kentucky, in an attack authorities have described as a hate crime. In 2012, two students at FSU reported Beierle to police after he grabbed their buttocks at a dining hall on campus, according to FSU Police Department reports.

(AP) \u2014 A quick eye by Goodwill workers in southern New Jersey turned up framed pages from an original 1774 Philadelphia newspaper with an iconic \u201cUnite or Die\u201d snake design on the masthead.\n\nThe frayed Dec. 28, 1774, edition of the \u201cPennsylvania Journal and the Weekly Advertiser\u201d boasts three items signed by John Hancock, then president of the Provincial Congress, who pleads for the Colonies to fight back \u201cenemies\u201d trying to divide them.\n\nA jumble of small advertisements offer rewards for a lost horse or runaway apprentice, while another insists the poster will no longer pay his \u201cmisbehav(ing)\u201d wife\u2019s debts.\n\nThe discovery was first reported by NJ Pen, an online news site.\n\nBob Snyder of the New York auction house Cohasco says the \u201crebel\u201d newspaper shows how \u201ceveryone was good and mad\u201d at the British just months before the Revolutionary War began. The masthead design is a variant of the \u201cJoin, or Die\u201d political cartoon credited to Benjamin Franklin.\n\n\u201cThese were very important propaganda tools,\u201d Snyder said of newspapers and pamphlets of the era. \u201cThe viciousness then in some was as much or more as it is today. . (But) the language was more powerful in putting down the other side.\u201d\n\nSnyder estimates the newspaper\u2019s value at $6,000 to $16,000. Goodwill Industries hopes to sell it to help funds its educational and job-training services, according to Heather Randall, e-commerce manager of the regional operation in Bellmawr, New Jersey.\n\nThe framed document was dropped off in Woodbury, New Jersey, and sent to her department, which reviews donations that may be valuable, and lists the best among them on Shopgoodwill.com. Employee Mike Storms did the detective work, guessing it was original given small keyholes at the inside edge of the pages that suggest they had once been bound by string. What\u2019s more, the four pages were preserved in an old frame with glass on both sides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a big treasure hunt, really, because you never know what\u2019s going to come through. Sometimes, the things take a lot of research,\u201d Randall said.\n\n\u201cWe got a Bill of Rights the other day, but it was (printed by) the Phillip Morris Tobacco Company,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cIt looked good.\u201d\n\nThere are three other existing copies of the same weekly edition of the Pennsylvania Journal, all housed in university collections. Randall hopes this one will find a home in the Philadelphia area where the public can see it. She posted it for sale on the Goodwill website for 15 days earlier this year, but the listing didn\u2019t get widespread interest. Snyder believes it should.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only three or four months until the first actual shots of the revolution were fired. So by this time, everybody was good and mad,\u201d said Snyder, who said newspapers of the day were more partisan than today, although the level of debate was more highbrow. The Pennsylvania Journal was published by William and Thomas Bradford, who came from a distinguished local family of booksellers and printers.\n\n\u201cThey obviously had a very strong belief system. They were willing to risk their lives to publish,\u201d he said.\n\nStorms nonetheless found some irony in the sign-offs that ended many of the submissions.\n\n\u201cWith all the anger and angst they have toward Great Britain, they still sign things \u2018God Save the King,\u2019\u201d he said.", "url": "https://apnews.com/0be8910e4060486ca2f8f93d70f738d6", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 42, "title": "Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon", "text": "Stocks plummeted on Wednesday as a sharp drop in tech shares and worries about corporate earnings added fuel to this month's steep pullback.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 608.01 points at 24,583.42 and erased all of its gains for 2018.

The affidavit unsealed today in Los Angeles noted the connections between the defendants in both cases.\n\nRAM and its members documented and promoted their white supremacy ideology through postings on various internet platforms and through graffiti, including tags found in Irvine. In a video posted online earlier this year and described in the complaint, Rundo said he was \u201ca big supporter of the fourteen,\u201d which is a reference to the \u201c14 words,\u201d a slogan used by white supremacists and neo-Nazis that reads: \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2018, Rundo and two of the men charged in the Charlottesville case travelled to Europe to celebrate Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday and to meet with members of other white supremacy extremist groups, according to the complaint.\n\n\u201cRundo, Boman, Laube, and Eason, along with other RAM members, have used the internet to prepare to incite and participate in violence at various political events, have committed violent assaults while at those events, and have applauded each other for it and publicly documented their assaults in order to recruit more members to engage in further assaults,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nA criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.

He rarely makes eye contact with Moffat, staring instead at what must be the cue cards, he delivers jokes like he\u2019s reading them for the first time, and at one point it seems like he either skipped some lines or a last-minute edit rendered the dialogue nonsensical, because he answers, \u201cThat depends on how much you want to visit your family,\u201d in answer to a question no one asked. But the great convergence happens when SNL tries to be reassuring. De Niro is supposed to deliver the following lines, both of which are apparently meant sincerely and both of which are transparently false:\n\nBut Eric, I just came here to let you know that no matter what happens America is going to be just fine. This is a country full of good people.\n\nIt seems like, from De Niro\u2019s strange pause, nod, and stutter on \u201cno matter what happens\u201d that a cue card didn\u2019t get changed when it was supposed to. It\u2019s live TV, these things happen, people keep going. But this time it happened while one of the celebrities SNL has cast as a Trump crony was delivering lines he didn\u2019t seem to have seen before in a tone that made them sound sarcastic while not making eye contact with the person he was supposedly talking to. The result is hard to watch, but weirdly, it ends up being more honest than the sketch would have been if they\u2019d executed it flawlessly. There are a lot of people going around spreading the message that America is going to be just fine despite Donald Trump, because America is full of good people. But to look someone in the eye and say that you believe that things are going to turn out okay because of the essential goodness of the same people who elected Donald Trump\u2014well. You\u2019d have to be a better actor than Robert De Niro.\n\nLet\u2019s block ads!
